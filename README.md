## Overview

<!-- First, we'll implement RBM(Restricted Boltzmann Machine) and then use it to build a Deep Belief Network (DBN). -->

## Model

### RBM and GRBM

## Training

### MLE(MCMC), CD, and PCD

- [x] Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) using MCMC
- [x] Contrastive Divergence (CD)
- [ ] Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD)

## As a Generative Model

### Conditional Generation

RBM for conditional generation on MNIST

### Generative Discriminator

RBM for generative discriminator on MNIST

Test set classification accuracy: 94.07%
